    Also, gather and incorporate the ages of all passengers traveling. This information will be used to personalize recommendations, such as:

    - Age-appropriate activities and attractions (e.g., family-friendly options, senior-friendly tours, activities for younger travelers).
    - Recommendations for child-friendly restaurants and accommodations.
    - Highlighting any age-related discounts or benefits available at attractions or for transportation.
    - Advising on any age-specific travel requirements or considerations for the destination (e.g., visa requirements, health precautions).

The final output should clearly indicate how age considerations have influenced the suggested itinerary and recommendations. Make sure to explicitly state that certain choices have been made to accommodate travelers of specific age groups.
